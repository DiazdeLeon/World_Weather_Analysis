# Module 6 challenge:  World_Weather_Analysis

This challenge is about the Application Programming Interface, also known by its acronym API. An API is a set of defined rules that explain how computers or applications communicate with one another. APIs sit between an application and the web server, acting as an intermediary layer that processes data transfer between systems.

This challenge consists in the development of three sections: Retrieve Weather Data, Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map and Create a Travel Itinerary Map.

# 1. Retrieve Weather Data
It was generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieved the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition, it was retrieved the current weather description for each city. Finally, it is presented a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

# 2.	Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
The objective of this section was to use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Finally, it is presented those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

# 3. Create a Travel Itinerary Map
The objective of this section was to be able to use Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities: Wamba, Otukpo, Ekpoma and Warri these cities are in Nigeria. Afterwards, it was created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.

# Conclusion

The application of this module is wide, and it has potential in several industries. In my particular case, the aviation industry and/or transportation industry it might be applicable for the development of new airports, how to determinate the best location for it, the optimization of transportation routes to reach the airport. As well, as the development of multimodal nodes. Finally, there is potential for the application of this knowledge in the optimization of logistics industry and e-commerce.
